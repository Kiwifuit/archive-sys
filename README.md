# archive-sys

Low-level bindings to [`libarchive`](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive) since [the other crate](https://github.com/fnichol/libarchive-rust) became unmaintained.

I wanted bindings to `libarchive` because I felt frustrated with all the archiving crates and wanted a hail-mary-ish solution, so I went and looked for rust bindings to `libarchive` only to see it unmaintained.

Please do note that I'll only occasionally update this crate's version to mirror my machine's `libarchive` version
